Key insight:

if you can do something, you don't understand, to understand it you have to ask right questions.


I have restarted learning Programming again initially I had chose python, I know basic syntax and it was very interesting to me but I found out web development would be more interesting enabling to create web apps.

I Learning from the Odin Project, currently I Have completed few introductory parts, though I didn't learn anything about programming right now, but I was given a lot of background knowledge and advice so I know what I'm doing, maintain consistency in learning and don't give up.

I like how THE ODIN PROJECT has structured their curriculum, and I'll continuing to learn more the next day, not more today despite it morning because if there is too much strain of new habit, that habit eventually breaks, so it be better if do one then zero.

My personal belief is, if there is a destination there must be a direction it is not who you lack to capability to find it but is your will to error correct and follow through.

I have know key insight which is you can't do something you don't understand it, and you can understand it by asking right questions. (if questions are right, then valid answers will be right)
